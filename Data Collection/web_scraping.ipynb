Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable.”', 'C.S. Lewis'], ['“Not all those who wander are lost.”', 'J.R.R. Tolkien'], ['“Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love.”', 'J.K.

Some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day. You shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense.”', 'Ralph Waldo Emerson'], ['“I have never let my schooling interfere with my education.”', 'Mark Twain'], [\"“I have heard there are troubles of more than one kind.

What truly horrible lives they must lead.”', 'Charles Bukowski'], ['“The trouble with having an open mind, of course, is that people will insist on coming along and trying to put things in it.”', 'Terry Pratchett'], ['“Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try!”', 'Dr. Seuss'], [\"“What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it.
